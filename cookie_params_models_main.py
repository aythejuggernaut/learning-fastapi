app = FastAPI()

# class Cookies(BaseModel):
#     session_idd: str
#     fatebook_tracker: str | None = None
#     googall_tracker: str | None = None

# Declare the cookie parameters that you need in a Pydantic model, and then declare the parameter as Cookie:
# @app.get("/items/")
# async def read_items(
#     cookies: Annotated[Cookies, Cookie()]
# ):
#     return cookies

# FastAPI will extract the data for each field from the cookies received in the request and give you the Pydantic model you defined.
# Have in mind that, as browsers handle cookies in special ways and behind the scenes, they don't easily allow JavaScript to touch them.

# ———————————————————— Forbid Extra Cookies ————————————————————
# In some special use cases (probably not very common), you might want to 
# restrict the cookies that you want to receive.
# Your API now has the power to control its own cookie consent.
# You can use Pydantic's model configuration to forbid any extra fields:
class Cookies(BaseModel):
    model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}
    
    session_idd: str
    fatebook_tracker: str | None = None
    googall_tracker: str | None = None

# @app.get("/items/")
# async def read_items(
#     cookies: Annotated[Cookies, Cookie()]
# ):
#     return cookies

# If a client tries to send some extra cookies, they will receive an error 
# response.
# For example, if the client tries to send a santa_tracker cookie with a value of good-list-please, the client will receive an error response telling them that the santa_tracker cookie is not allowed:
# {
#     "detail": [
#         {
#             "type": "extra_forbidden",
#             "loc": ["cookie", "santa_tracker"],
#             "msg": "Extra inputs are not permitted",
#             "input": "good-list-please",
#         }
#     ]
# }

# ———————————————————— Combine Parameter Models ————————————————————
# You can combine multiple cookie parameter models with individual cookie 
# parameters and dependencies. Each model is extracted and validated 
# independently,
# Each model's extra configuration applies to all cookie parameters, including 
# those declared in other models or dependencies. With extra="forbid", any 
# cookie outside that model is rejected. With extra="allow", those cookies are included as model extras.

# ———————————————————— Optional Cookie Parameter Models ————————————————————
class Preferences(BaseModel):
    theme: str
    locale: str


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(preferences: Annotated[Preferences | None, Cookie()] = None):
    return preferences

# Declare a cookie parameter model with | None and a default of None to make 
# the group optional.
# If neither theme nor locale is sent, preferences is None. If either is sent, 
# FastAPI validates the model and requires both fields.
